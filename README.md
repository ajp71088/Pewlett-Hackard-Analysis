# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is anticipating a massive changeover in their personnel due to an expected wave of retirees. To help prepare for this "silver tsunami," I used SQL to determine the number of employees that may be retiring per job title, and to help identify candidates to serve as mentors for their replacements.

### Results
- There are over 70,000 employees who are about to retire

- Senior Engineers & Senior Staff are the job titles that are going to be most impacted by the "silver tsunami," each with over 2.5 times as many expected retirements as the next nearest job title

- The 50,842 employees with a senior job title retiring soon account for over 70% of the total expected retirees.

- There are only about 1,500 employees that fit the criteria for the mentorship program, so without loosening those requirements each mentor would have to oversee approximately 46 new hires (assuming every retirement is replaced on a 1:1 ratio).
